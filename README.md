# Ian-Corbett-Portfolio

This is a project that I have built from scratch. I needed to write all of the html code as well as all of the css code. I am making this project in order to have a well made portfolio that can be viewed in the future by prospective employers. It also will serve as a convenient place to save some of my best projects. I intend to update this page throughout my time doing the bootcamp, as I complete more projects and improve my skills in web development.

This project was made as practice for setting up a website without any starter code. In this project, I learned a lot about styling various elements on my page, and how to use different display types to put things where i wanted them to be onn the website. Additionally, I learned how to make it so that buttons contain links to other websites, and I can now link to my other work. Another fun thing that I learned was using unicode values to get emojis onto the webpage.

Throughout building this, there have been many bugs that have had to be dealt with. Most of these occured when moving my code from VSCode to Github. Therefore there are a lot of commits in this repo, many of which may have been slightly unnecessary. I have had trouble getting my html and css to actually show up when I visit the deployed site. Additionally, sometimes when i upload to github, my deployed website only shows my readme page. This has taught me that I need to spend more time familiarizing myself with Github so that my uploads go more smoothly.

This whole project was created using just HTML and CSS. In future websites that I will build, javascript will be included as well, but this site doesnt need to be super interactive, so html and css suffice. 

In this project, I made sure that all the links were working, and I made many changes to the resizing. This allows the elements to keep all of the text in the correct spaces and not allow it to overflow. Additionally, it allows the proper elements to be moved to new parts of the page to keep it looking professional. I also created a layout that I think will be optimal for a portfolio. I created a large container that has a link to my most recent project, as well as six smaller spaces for future projects. The links take you to the project that youre looking for, and there is a symmetrical layout that I believe makes navigating the site simple and quick.

The website is quite simple. There is a header bar that contains links to all 6 of the additional projects that are currently yet to come. There is also a link the my github, my newest project, as well as biographical information and contact information.

CREDITS: In this project I have borrowed various images from the web. Here are the links for those images:
