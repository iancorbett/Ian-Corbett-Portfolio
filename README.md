# Ian-Corbett-Portfolio

This is a project that I have built from scratch. I needed to write all of the html code as well as all of the css code. I am making this project in order to have a well made portfolio that can be viewed in the future by prospective employers. It also will serve as a convenient place to save some of my best projects.

This project was made as practice for setting up a website without any starter code. In this project, I learned a lot about styling various elements on my page, and how to use different displat types to put things where i wanted them to be onn the website. Additionally, I learned how to make it so that buttons contain links to other websites, and I can now link to my other work.

Throughout building this, there have been many bugs that have had to be dealt with. Most of these occured when moving my code from VSCode to Github. Therefore there are a lot of commits in this repo, many of which may have been slightly unnecessary. I have had trouble getting my html and css to actually show up when I visit the deployed site.

This whole project was created using just HTML and CSS.

In this project, I made sure that all the links were working, and I made many changes to the resizing. This allows the elements to keep all of the text in the correct spaces and not allow it to overflow. Additionally, it allows the proper elements to be moved to new parts of the page to keep it looking professional. 

The project is quite simple. There are three links, and they each take the reader to the appropriate section of the the page, upon being clicked.
